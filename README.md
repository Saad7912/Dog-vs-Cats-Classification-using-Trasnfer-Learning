# Dog vs. Cats Classification using Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2

This repository contains code and resources for a Dog vs. Cats Classification project utilizing Transfer Learning with MobileNetV2. The project aims to build a highly accurate model capable of distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.

## Repository Structure

- **scripts/train_model.py**: A Python script to train the MobileNetV2 model on the dog vs. cat dataset. It handles model training and saves the trained model for later use.
- **scripts/evaluate_model.py**: A Python script for evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset. It provides accuracy and other performance metrics.
- **scripts/predict.py**: A Python script for making predictions on new images using the trained model. It takes an image as input and outputs whether it's a dog or a cat.

## Installation
